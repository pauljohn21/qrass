//! sasspile — a clean-room SCSS→CSS compiler architected as a **PUSH (rxrust) stream**: a
//! source pushes owned values *forward* through operators (`from_iter → scan_map → flat_map →
//! filter → collect → into_future`), and is **never** pulled/walked as a materialized AST.
//!
//! This crate was reset to a from-scratch skeleton after adopting the push doctrine
//! (`dart-sass = pull / rxrust = push`). The old pull-shaped code (parse→AST→recursive walk)
//! has been deleted to prevent backsliding. The pipeline is rebuilt phase by phase (P0–P8)
//! per `openspec/changes/redesign-sasspile-rxrust-shared-stream/design.md`. Governed by
//! `.qoder/rules/rust.md`; behaviour oracle = `sass-spec/*.hrx` + `element-plus` only.
